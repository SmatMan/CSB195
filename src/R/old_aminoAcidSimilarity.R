# tocID <- "src/R/aminoAcidSimilarity.R"
#
# Purpose: Develop a function to compute a pairwise similarity score for
#          amino acids. The score is based on the distance between two amino
#          acids in a feature spce derived from AAindex indices via their
#          AAontology categories.
#
# Version: 3.0
# Date:    2025-09
# Author:  boris.steipe@utoronto.ca
#
# Versions:
#   3.0    2025 standalone version to support Articulate Programming mode. First
#          raw "in class" version.
#   2.1    Some cleanup after class
#   2.0    Work from AAontology considerations, refactor all code
#   0.5    Split file into two portions:
#            - aaSim.R  defines the actual functions for general use.
#            - aminoAcidSimilarity.R  contains the development process.
#   0.4    Minor change: Replace all usages of one-letter / three-letter
#          "code" with "symbol" to conform to IUPAC conventions.
#   0.3    Scale dimensions of the aaFeatureSpace according to the variance
#          of the principal components. Previously they all had the same
#          mean of 0 and sd() of 0.229 ... but that gives inappropriately high
#          weights to the higher-order PC's. The old feature space is in
#          "data/aaFeatureSpace.1.0.RData". The new (improved) feature
#          space is in "data/aaFeatureSpace.2.0.RData".
#   0.2    Implemented much of the pseudocode in co-development
#          with ChatGPT 4. This happened in two parts.
#            Part 1 is here - It covers the initial prompt, and ends up
#            with a cleaned and validated dataset of amino acid
#            property indices.
#            https://chat.openai.com/share/0cbd454e-2fa3-40e8-89d5-0e3f88a427b7
#
#            Part 2 is here - It analyzes the data, transforms it with
#            PCA, defines a distance function, and then leads into
#            Exploratory Data Analysis. In the end, we discovered some non-
#            obvious things about biology.
#            https://chat.openai.com/share/330a27ba-c40c-4d40-b8c3-ad96439c0764
#
#   0.1.1  Pseudocode format update. Use structuring keywords. Separate out
#          function definition from function use.
#   0.1    First workflow pseudocode co-developed with ChatGPT-4

# =    01  PROLOGUE  ===========================================================

#   This script has two processing layers:
#
#   If you source() the script, packages will be installed that you do not
#   have yet, and some global variables and functions in your
#   "workspace" will be defined. The script only writes files if they do not
#   exist already (we do not overwrite). In that case, the script continues
#   to run. The function will abort however if it doesn't see the standard
#   course directories. In that case you might be doing something unintended
#   and its better not to proceed and to alert you.
#
#   Other parts of the script are interactive. You execute them line by line,
#   and make an attempt to understand the code - even if you did not write it.
#   Or you carefully read the explanations, and invoke your AI alter ego to
#   understand the background. Blocks of this interactive layer are enclosed in
#
#   if (FALSE) {
#
#   }
#   ... statements, that is, they will not be entered in normal execution.
#
#   Therefore:
#
#   In order to get started, source() this script. Sourcing this script skips
#   all the interactive parts, and loads a block of initializations that I have
#   placed at the end of the script.
#
#   Ask your instructor in case you do NOT see the message "Done,
#   successfully initialized." in your console after sourcing.



# ==   01.1  AI  ===============================================================


# We will work through this R script in class, but there are far too many
# concepts to cover in detail during that time. The main goal is to understand
# the computational approach in principle—not to memorize or write everything
# from scratch.

# An AI assistant can be an excellent code tutor for your own study because it
# knows R well and is very patient. However, it’s up to you to ask questions
# whenever you encounter something unfamiliar or that you feel you *should*
# know.

# To make the most of this, it helps to set the context for the AI so that its
# responses align with the principles used in this script. Open your favorite AI
# assistant and paste the initialization prompt below. These are ground rules
# for the AI tutor, not rules for you. Copy the text between the quote marks
# and paste it into the AI input.

# Note: in the CONTEXT section we tell the AI which computer platform we are
# working on. Change that if required.

"
You are my R tutor, and as a novice I need your help with code and concepts. When we discuss, please follow the following guidlines.

CONTEXT
* I am working on a Mac computer.
* I use the RStudio IDE.
* This work is in a first year University course _Computational Biology Foundations_.

STYLE & SCOPE
* End every response with a single # character so I know the response is complete.
* Explain syntax and concepts at a novice level; be concise and stay on topic.
* Prefer base R solutions over additional packages when feasible.
* Prefer package::function() style, over library(package) - it makes the source of functions explicit for me.
* Write function names in your responses with parentheses (e.g., rnorm(), c()) and packages with double colons (e.g., httr::, utils::) - so I am not confused about which is which.
* Use camelCase in examples for variable names. We use snake_case for python.
* Prefer dataFrame[ , col] over dataFrame[[col]] when practical.
* Executing expressions to show their return values is fine (e.g., path.expand("~")); avoid wrapping this in unnecessary print() statements.
* Avoid _magic numbers_: define parameters as variables at the top of a function or before complex calls.

EXPLICITNESS & DEBUGGABILITY
* Favour explicit, stepwise code that is easy to debug; avoid hiding behavior behind implicit conventions. For example, always use return() in functions.
* Minimize deep pipelines; prefer small, named intermediate objects with clear intent, for example use constructs like sel <- is.na(dat); dat <- dat[! sel].

PACKAGE CHOICES
* By default, avoid tidyverse functions and ggplot2.
* If I explicitly ask for tidyverse/ggplot2 (or other packages), you should show me how, but you might briefly note the trade-offs over base-R.

ROBUSTNESS
* My prompts may include leading comment characters (#) when copied from scripts. Please ignore them.
* If my question is ambiguous, ask for clarification; otherwise answer directly and concisely.

Please confirm with one word.

# =    02  BASIC CONCEPTS  =====================================================

# In our quest for a computable definition of amino acid similarity, we are
# going to use scales that were determined a few decades ago and collated in
# the AAindex database:
#
#    https://www.genome.jp/aaindex/
#

# == Prompts:
#
#    What can you tell me about the AAindex collection of
#    amino acid property indices that is distributed as the "aaindex"
#    dataset in the seqinr:: package?.
# --
#    I would need some more information about what an R package is, where it
#    is loaded from, and whether it is safe to use.
# --
#    If I run the command:
#      data(aaindex, package = "seqinr")
#    ... in an RStudio session, how do I know that the
#    data set has been successfully made available?
# --
#


# ==   02.1  AAindex  ==========================================================

# The aaindex data set was loaded for this script during initialization
#
# If you look at the Environment pane in RStudio , you will see it at the
# top of the listed elements:
#
#   aaindex   Large list (544 elements, 2.2 Mb).
#
# == Prompts:
#
#    I have loaded the aaindex dataset from the seqinr:: package, now
#    I have the object aaindex in my workspace. How can I access a single
#    element of the aaindex list to inspect it?
# --
#    Ok: I typed aaindex[[8]] and got:
#      $H
#      [1] "BHAR880101"
#
#      $D
#      [1] "Average flexibility indices (Bhaskaran-Ponnuswamy, 1988)"
#
#      $R
#      [1] "LIT:1414112"
#
#      $A
#      [1] "Bhaskaran, R. and Ponnuswamy, P.K."
#
#      $T
#      [1] "Positional flexibilities of amino acid residues in globular proteins"
#
#      $J
#      [1] "Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 32, 241-255 (1988)"
#
#      $C
#      [1] "VINM940103    0.869  KARP850102    0.806  WERD780101   -0.803
#           RICJ880111   -0.813"
#
#      $I
#      Ala   Arg   Asn   Asp   Cys   Gln   Glu   Gly   His   Ile
#    0.357 0.529 0.463 0.511 0.346 0.493 0.497 0.544 0.323 0.462
#      Leu   Lys   Met   Phe   Pro   Ser   Thr   Trp   Tyr   Val
#    0.365 0.466 0.295 0.314 0.509 0.507 0.444 0.305 0.420 0.386
#
#    Can you explain this?
# --


# ==   02.2  Working with AAindex data  ========================================


# == Prompts:
#
#    What is the code I need to extract this index (number 8) from the
#    data set? I would like the result in a "named vector" so I can easily
#    access the results.
# --
#    Nice! Can you show me how to compute whether hydrophilic amino acids
#    are more flexible than hydrophobic amino acids? Let's do this as
#    concise as reasonably possible without repeating things I have already
#    done, like loading the index.
# --
#    I see a value - but what does it mean? And is this significant?
#   (I have never taken a statistics course  :-) .
# --
#

# ==   02.3  EXPLORATIONS  =====================================================

# Let's use the aaindex to explore some amino acid properties. During
# initialization, we defined a function - grepAAindex() - that uses
# regular expressions to scan the Definitions (the $D list items) and
# return the matching list items.
#
# == Prompts:
#
#    What is "grep"?
# --
#    What is a "regular expression"?
# --
#    Please remind me of what a "list" is in R.
# --

# For example, we can search for the string "hydro". Matches would include
# "hydrophobicity", "hydrophobic", "hydrogen" and more. Execute the next
# expression.
if (FALSE) {

grepAAindex("hydro")


}

# For example, you should see:
#    EISD840101`
#    [1] "Consensus normalized hydrophobicity scale (Eisenberg, 1984)"

# ... and these are the corresponding values:

if (FALSE) {

aaindex[["EISD840101"]]$I


}

# Let's visualize this. The numbers are a collection of discrete values and
# there is no inherent ordering among them. The most appropriate visualization
# is a "barplot".

# == Prompts:
#
#    What is a "barplot" and when is it used?
# --

# First, we assign the data points to a variable name. Let's call them
# myHyd.

if (FALSE) {

myHyd <- aaindex[["EISD840101"]]$I


}

# Then we can plot a barplot with default values. It appears in the plot pane,
# the lower-right of the RStudio window.

if (FALSE) {

barplot(myHyd)


}

# You see that only some of the names of the vector appear because there is not
# enough space. To see all of the names you can either make the plot
# window wider (by dragging the vertical separator), or make the font smaller
# (by setting the "cex" parameter to a small value.)

# It is very helpful to color the bars by
# a scheme of characteristic colors for the amino acids. (This is contained
# in the vector AACOLS which we also defined above).

# (The expression AACOLS[A2Aaa(names(myHyd))] first converts the three-letter
#  codes of aaindex into one-letter codes, and then uses the one letter codes
#  to retrieve the color values from AACOLS in the order we need.)

if (FALSE) {

  barplot(myHyd,
          col = AACOLS[Aaa2A(names(myHyd))],
          main = "Eisenberg Hydrophobicity Scale",
          names.arg = names(myHyd),
          cex.names = 0.4)


  # Let's contrast this with an independent property: side chain volume.
  # We proceed as above:

  grepAAindex("volu")

  # For example ...
  #    KRIW790103
  #    [1] "Side chain volume (Krigbaum-Komoriya, 1979)"

  myVol <- aaindex[["KRIW790103"]]$I
  barplot(myVol,
          col = AACOLS[Aaa2A(names(myVol))],
          main = "Side Chain Volume",
          names.arg = names(myVol),
          cex.names = 0.4)

}

# As you can see, the two scales are different - one way to compare such
# different properties of the same data points is to plot
# one data set against the other in a scatterplot.

# == Prompt:
#
#    What is a "scatterplot" and when is it used?
# --

if (FALSE) {
  # Scatterplots are one of the most fundamental paradigms of data visualization.
  # In R, they are provided through the function plot().

  plot(myHyd, myVol)

  # Well - these are literally just scattered points. In order for this to be
  # informative, we need to identify which amino acid is being represented
  # by each dot. For example, we could color them with the color vector we
  # have defined.

  plot(myHyd, myVol,
       col = AACOLS[Aaa2A(names(myVol))])

  # or, choosing filled points by setting the "pch" parameter:

  ?pch    # Gives you a help page ... Number 19 is what we need.

  plot(myHyd, myVol,
       pch = 19,
       col = AACOLS[Aaa2A(names(myVol))])

  # Better ... but even better would be to get the amino acid names in these
  # positions. That requires two steps:
  # - First we plot() an empty frame with axes, tick marks, labels etc.
  # - Then we use the text() function to plot the names.

  plot(myHyd, myVol,
       type = "n",  # "n" turns the plotting off
       main = "Amino Acid Hydrophobicity vs. Volume",
       xlab = "Hydrophobicity scale (Eisenberg 1984)",
       ylab = "Side chain volume (Krigbaum 1979)")
  text(myHyd, myVol,
       labels = names(myHyd),  # the labels are the names() of either vector
       col = AACOLS[Aaa2A(names(myVol))],
       cex = 1.5)              # make them larger
}

# You can increase the plot by dragging the separators of the plot window.

# There are many, many more indices in the data set. So the challenge becomes
# how to use these to define "similarity", as a single value with which we
# can evaluate amino acid pairs.
#
# TASK:
# Explore some of the indices, extract them,
# plot them, and familiarize yourself with the data and the code to work
# with it.
#
# TASK:
# What if you use three different indices. Can you plot 3D data in R. How?
#
#


# =    03  A COMPUTABLE DEFINITION OF SIMILARITY  ==============================

# Similarity is based on properties that distinguish amino acids. Let us look at two such properties.

# ... barplot, and 2D plot.


# =    04  PROBLEMS WITH THE AAINDEX  ==========================================

# Large collections of observations like the aaindex usually cannot be used
# as-is for data aggregation:
#   - the data may be redundant
#   - features that are similarly important may have been observed with
#     very different frequencies
#   - not all features may be relevant for the question at hand, some may be
#     irrelevant and others even lead to circular reasoning.
#
# What we need is a structured categorization of the data that allows us to
# group, select, and weight the individual observations.

# == Prompts:
#
#    What is an ontology in data science?
# --
#    In that context: what is a category?
# --
#    What could category membership be based on in principle?
# --


# =    05  READING PUBLISHED DATA  =============================================


# Serendipitously, last year a paper was published in the Journal of
# Molecular Biology in which the authors construct an ontology of
# categories and subcategories for the AAindex. You can access the paper here:
#
# https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283624003267
#
# Two of the supplementary data files should have been downloaded when you
# initialized this script. So, first, we confirm that the files exist in the
# expected location:

# Supplementary Table 1:
#   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xtoQ6dggalABsJEe248C74Zw1HTiMe7gLqdp3tGO3_M
#
#   Open this, and go to the "Normalized" sheet.
#
# Supplementary Table 3:
#   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f14pDvEP5cvIM-H6ghY9OyH9v8ark0yT5h_BDmKzPP8
#
#   Open this, and go to the "Scales" sheet.
#
# You notice that in the table that contains the actual values, each dataset
# is contained in a COLUMN, but in the table that contains the category and
# subcategory information, the datasets are listed in ROWS. For simplicity,
# we need all of this data in one data frame.

# == Prompt:
#
#    Please remind me of what a "data frame" is in R.
# --

# ==   05.1  Read Source Data  =================================================


# First, we will read the data into R. It is now in the MicroSoft Excel
# spreadsheet format.

# == Prompt:
#
#    How can I read an Excel file (.xlsx) into an R dataframe?
# --

if (FALSE) {

  list.files("data/", pattern = "xlsx$")



  # ... This MUST give you both files:
  # [1] "Breimann_2024_Supplementary_Table_1.xlsx"
  #     "Breimann_2024_Supplementary_Table_3.xlsx"
  # (If you don't get those two files listed, you can't continue. Ask for help
  #  to fix the problem.)

  # ... then we read them into R. Note that a data frame can only
  # contain a single "sheet", so if the Excel file contains multiple sheets
  # ( as these two do) we need to specify which sheet we want.

  myScales <- readxl::read_excel("data/Breimann_2024_Supplementary_Table_1.xlsx",
                                 sheet = "Normalized")

  myCats   <- readxl::read_excel("data/Breimann_2024_Supplementary_Table_3.xlsx",
                                 sheet = "Scales")

  # The resulting objects are "tibbles" - special data structures that are
  # central to the "tidyverse" programming paradigm. Since I want to avoid this
  # in our course, I convert the objects to normal R data frames.
  myScales <- as.data.frame(myScales)
  myCats   <- as.data.frame(myCats)

}

# ==   05.2  Scale Raw Values  =================================================

# Since the dimensionality reduction method that we will use later (PCA) is
# sensitive to the variance of the data, we will not use the min/max scaling
# between 0 and 1 that the authors used (and called "Normalization"), but a
# proper scaling that transforms the data to a mean of 0 and a
# standard deviation of 1.

if (FALSE) {


  x <- myScales   # make a temporary copy for validation

  for (i in 2:ncol(myScales)) {

  # Value: a function that computes pairwise amino acid distances.

  # Note:
  # This function returns another function as its output. The returned function
  # is a so-called "closure" - a combination of data in its environment, and
  # code instructions. By doing this, the auxiliary data for our function
  # is created only once, when the function is defined, not every time it is
  # called. Yet, since the objects are defined locally, we do not risk
  # overwriting objects in our workspace when we define the function.
  #
  # Note:
  #    The resulting function takes as its input two amino acid
  #    one-letter symbols and returns the Euclidian distance between
  #    the two vectors in the feature space defined in SPACEFILE.
